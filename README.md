# Rubik's Cube Algorithm to Pictures Converter


## NOTE: THIS PROJECT WAS GENERATED BY OPENAI's CHATGPT

Completely forgot to add this release, so I'm adding it now.
I also forgot to backup the png files, so I got them from [de.wikibooks.org](https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zauberw%C3%BCrfel/_3x3x3/_Notation) saved, renamed and converted them to png files.

Just write your algorithm notations into the algorithms.txt inside the zip (extract it beforehand)
and execute the jar using `java -jar RubiksCubeAlgorithmToPicturesConverter.jar`.

Please note that the notations need to match the png files inside the `images` folder.

Then it should merge those image files into new png files. Note that you should
write one Algorithm per line.


This will be probably the only release needed, because I don't think that there will be something that would need to be optimized.

If you think I'm wrong, feel free to open an issue and I will try to let ChatGPT fix it.
